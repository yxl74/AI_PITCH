```

### The Unique Value of OS-Level Intelligence:

| Data Type | App Level | OS Level (Samsung) | Value to AI Companies |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Purchase Intent** | ❌ Can't see | ✅ Full journey | Know when research becomes buying |
| **Decision Timeline** | ❌ No data | ✅ Complete path | Understand consideration period |
| **Competitor Usage** | ❌ Invisible | ✅ Clear patterns | See where users go next |
| **Task Completion** | ❌ Fragmented | ✅ End-to-end | Track actual outcomes |

### Example Intelligence:
**"Samsung data reveals that 67% of users who ask ChatGPT for product recommendations switch to Claude for detailed comparisons before buying"**
- ChatGPT doesn't know they lost the sale
- Claude doesn't know they closed it
- **Only Samsung can sell this intelligence**

## Slide 8: Privacy-First Design

## **On-Device AI Protection**

### What We Actually Sell (Privacy-Preserved Examples):

#### ✅ **Data We Share (After PII Removal):**

**AI Usage Patterns:**
```json
{
  "user_segment": "power_user_travel",
  "ai_usage": {
    "chatgpt": "45% - trip planning",
    "claude": "30% - detailed reviews",
    "perplexity": "25% - price research"
  },
  "journey_time": "avg_47_minutes",
  "conversion_rate": "23%"
}
```

**Cross-Platform Behaviors:**
- "User researches for 20+ minutes before purchases over $500"
- "82% probability of using Claude after ChatGPT for complex tasks"
- "Peak AI usage Tuesday mornings, 9-11 AM"
- "Switches to Perplexity for fact-checking in 31% of sessions"
