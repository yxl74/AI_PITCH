- **On-device summarization LLM** for privacy preservation
- **Differential privacy** implementation
- **Cryptographic audit trails**

---

## Slide 7: How It Works

## **Three Simple Steps**

### For Users:
1. **Use Your Phone Normally** - No behavior change required
2. **Review & Approve** - See exactly what data is shared (with PII removed)
3. **Get Paid Monthly** - Direct deposits to your account

### For Data Buyers:
1. **Access Aggregated Intelligence** - Cross-agent patterns and behaviors
2. **Receive Verified Data** - Cryptographically authenticated
3. **Pay for Value** - Direct marketplace pricing

---

## Slide 8: Privacy-First Design

## **On-Device AI Protection**

### The Summarization LLM Process:

**Before Processing:**
- Full user activity with personal information
- Specific locations, names, account details

**After On-Device AI:**
- Behavioral patterns only
- Categories instead of specifics
- Aggregated insights without PII

### User Control Panel Example:
```
Data Summary for This Month:
✅ Will Share:
- AI usage patterns by category
- General time-of-day preferences
- App switching sequences

❌ Never Shared:
- Your name or identity
- Specific queries or conversations
- Location data
- Account information
```
